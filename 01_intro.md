# 📘 Introduction to Java 8

## 🚨 Why Java 8?

Java 8 marked a major turning point in the evolution of the language. It was designed with three key intentions in mind:

---

### 1. ✂️ Concise and Minimal Code

Prior to Java 8, writing code often involved a lot of boilerplate. With new features like **lambda expressions** and **method references**, Java 8 enables developers to write more compact and readable code.

---

### 2. 🧠 Bringing Functional Programming to Java

Java has always been an **object-oriented** language, where everything revolves around classes and objects. But over time, developers started to feel that Java code was becoming too **verbose** and **boilerplate-heavy**, especially when trying to express simple behaviors.

Other modern languages were already taking advantage of **functional programming** — a style where functions are treated as first-class citizens, and code is more **concise**, **predictable**, and **expressive**.

So what was missing in Java?

- ✅ The ability to **pass logic as data** (e.g., passing a block of code to a method)
- ✅ Writing code that is more **declarative** (focusing on *what* to do, not *how* to do it)
- ✅ Encouraging **immutability** and avoiding side effects

Java 8 introduced features like **lambda expressions** and **functional interfaces**, which bring these capabilities into Java — **without abandoning its object-oriented roots**.

### 3. ⚡ Enabling Parallel and Multi-Core Programming

As hardware evolved with multi-core processors, software needed to catch up. Java 8 introduces tools (like the **Streams API**) that make **parallel processing** easier and more accessible, helping developers fully utilize modern CPUs.

Java 8 isn't just an update — it's a paradigm shift.  
It allows you to write **faster**, **cleaner**, and **more modern** Java code.
